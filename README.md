# Safe-Mini-Stl-Cpp
using some source code to build a safe and Mini-Stl code
Rather than implementing part of the allocator in memory, I use the object-oriented inheritance mechanism directly. Of course, there are not too many exceptions in the STL, so I simply use the rude way to do this.  
Of course,the source code uses lot of template,at the some time,I use little OOP of thought.at most ,it Packging on the SCPP namespace.  
there are some program for the Library.  
1.it does not achieve the Distrator,from the STL which version are sgi ,we can study the essential of uses and thoughts.
